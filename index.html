        <p id= "week-one">I've decided to start my journey to a more fulfilling career. Cosmetology has served it's purpose well for the past seven years through-out my young adulthood, however, I'm ready for something new. I can't wait to see what I'm capable of in the world of computer programming! 
        </p>
        
        <p id= "week-two">First things first; Apply to my local community college so that I can aquire a web certificate. This will make me feel more comfortable with the career change. Now, Khan Academy! While I patiently await my acceptance letter (I mean, it IS a community college, so I'll for sure be accepted right?...Right?!)I'll do what I can to give myself a headstart with it's HTML/CSS course. "Onward!"
